### Debugging

List facts and state of a host

    ansible <host> -m setup                            # All facts for one host
    ansible <host> -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_eth*'   # Only ansible fact for one host
    ansible all -m setup -a 'filter=facter_*'          # Only facter facts but for all hosts

Save facts to per-host files in /tmp/facts

    ansible all -m setup --tree /tmp/facts
